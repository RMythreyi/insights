*Looks like you've found the secret compartment where I'm storing future ideas. Now that you're here, feel free to browse through and give <a href="mailto:mythreyi.1.618@gmail.com">feedback</a>.*

### Coursework and Curriculum

* The pilot batch is graduating (a.k.a how the 2015 curriculum is good and bad)
* The art of elective allotment (through SEAT)
* Picking courses from across disciplines that match interests (a.k.a do your homework)
* Never underestimate your ability to learn something new in a new field (NLA)
* How to meet credit requirements (NPTEL is your friend)
* Prudently overloading semesters
* PoE is not the only option (open your mind using HS electives, or choose to chill)
* Are the extra Ds worth it? (IDDD)

### Research Related

* Seeking the "right" project and advisor
* The benefits of working on an undergraduate project
* The misguided chase for foreign research internships
* What one actually learns during foreign research experiences
* Turning up and sticking around - the key ingredients for learning by osmosis
* The post graduates on campus - each person has a story!
* The side effects of having a good rapport with professors

### Internships and Placements

* The "dreaded" fifth semester
* The placement team experience (third semester)
* An outsider's view of placements (ninth semester) (a.k.a. Please get a PPO!)

### CV/Resume - What to Draft & What to Craft

* It's okay to trust the unconventional (a.k.a. Always read smail)
* Reverse Engineering may not work
* The allure of Fest PoRs (and how they needn't be a solution)
* Always doing only what you want to do (yes, there are research related PoRs)

### The Clubs

* Finding the right people is more important than finding the right club
* The lasting impact of intro sessions

### Lifestyle Choices

* Night outs are overrated
* It's not the tea that matters, but the company
* Talking to everyone about what they like doing (and ignoring the rest)
* To be, or not to be (late)
* It's easier to inspire than to defend (spreading MM feels)
* The potentially vicious cycle of "insti circles"
