### Objective

People say *reading helps us expand our minds*. We have an ability to not just learn from our own experiences, but also from those of others. As someone who likes to do a lot of research behind my decisions, no matter how big or small they are, I have always been thrilled to find accounts of people having done things that I am going to do, or would like to do. In this light, I am trying to give back to the people out there who are like me. I aim to do that by populating this corner of the internet with insights that I believe I have learnt through my experiences.

### Background

I am **_Mythreyi Ramesh_**, and I did my undergraduate at the **Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM)**. Although the IITM campus lies in the heart of Chennai, one of the larger metropolitan cities in India, IITM itself is still a forest for all practical purposes. A large part of the campus is a protected forest, and some wildlife (and not so *wild* life) roam around freely. Living in a forest poses many unique problems and these problems inspire innovative "work-arounds" (if not solutions). Apart from the geographically induced challenges, the environment within the institute enables a plethora of opportunities for academic as well as extra curricular activities. I've noticed that this deluge of options and the freedom that it comes along with are the biggest challenges faced by everyone who goes through their undergraduate days at IITM.

The journey may be unique for each individual, and it's supposed to be that way. However, looking back, I realise that learning from other people has helped me to craft my journey to my satisfaction. I am now in my final year of studies and will be leaving the campus soon. Before I leave, I want to document my journey, not in excruciating detail, but distilled into discernible packets of insights. This blog is primarily my attempt at this pet project, put in a place where it can remain effective long after I leave this campus.

### Policy

I don't wish to preach here, instead, I'll let the way I describe some incident in my life speak for itself. However, this is a new endeavour for me, and I am sure I will not always stick to what I would like to have stuck to, including this "no preaching" philosophy. If you find a discrepancy somewhere and feel I can rephrase what I've said to convey what I mean to, be sure to <a href="mailto:mythreyi.1.618@gmail.com"> write </a> to me.

I hope that you find something useful here, and as always, take everything with a pinch (or in some cases, a table spoon) of salt. Needless to say, the opinions expressed here are my own.
