The adage *"reading helps us expand our minds"* could have originated from our ability to not just learn from our own experiences, but also through those of others, especially if it's offered to us in a digestible form. As someone who likes to do a lot of research behind my decisions, no matter big or small, I have always been thrilled to find accounts of people having done things that I am going to, or would like to do. In this light, I am trying to give back to the others out there who are like me. I aim to do that by populating this corner of the internet with insights that I believe I have learnt.
<br> <br>

I am **_Mythreyi Ramesh_**, and I am did my undergraduate at the **Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM)**. IITM is in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Although the IITM campus lies in the heart of Chennai, which is a metropolitan city, IITM is still a forest for all practical purposes. Wildlife (and not so wild life) roam around freely. This in itself poses many unique problems and these problems inspire innovative "work-arounds" (if not solutions).

Apart from the geographically induced challenges, the environment (academic, as well as extra curricular) offers a plethora of options. I've noticed that this deluge of options and the freedom that it comes along with is the biggest challenge faced by everyone who goes through their undergraduate days at IITM.
The journey is unique for each individual, and it's supposed to be that way. However, looking back, I realise that speaking to others has definitely helped me to craft my journey to my satisfaction. It is primarily this journey that I have tried to distill into discernible packets of insights and put it in a place where it can remain effective long after I leave this campus. (When I started this "blog", I was in my final year of studies and was leaving the campus soon.)

I don't wish to preach here, instead, I'll let the way I describe some incident in my life speak for itself. However, this is a new endeavour for me, and I am sure I will not always stick to what I would like to have stuck to, including this "no preaching" philosophy. If you find a discrepancy somewhere and feel I can rephrase what I've said to convey what I mean to, be sure to <a href="mailto:mythreyi.1.618@gmail.com"> write </a> to me.

I hope that you learn something here, and that everytime you visit, you leave a little wiser.
